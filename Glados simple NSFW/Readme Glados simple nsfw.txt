It means so there is no leaf bones for Blender. 
FBX Importer addon is recommended.

There is bones for all the pneumatics on armpits and neck, please use constraints in mode "aim at" or "look at" to rig them properly. 
Two bones of each pneumatic element should look at each other in order to work properly. 

The body contains blendshapes for emotions, breasts and nipples size and knee fixes for better bending on extreme angles. 

The "glowing" folder contains textures for glowing parts and masks for possible color overrides.
