Created with Cinema4D

It means so there is no leaf bones for Blender. 
FBX Importer addon is recommended.

There is bones for all the pneumatics on armpits and neck, please use constraints in mode "aim at" or "look at" to rig them properly. 
Two bones of each pneumatic element should look at each other in order to work properly. 

Each leg has a blendshape to help knees look better on extreme bending angles.
